## Notes

Part 1 was fairly straightforward, just had to nicely process the input.

For part two I ran a total of 2.037.733.040 iterations. Didn't want to spend more time optimizing my code, so I just let it run while I worked and hoped for the best. It only took 32934268.728ms, so just over 9 hours.

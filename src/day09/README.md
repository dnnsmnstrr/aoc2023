## Notes

Got through relatively easy, but I lost quite some time in pt. 2 because I copied my `predictNextHistoryValue` function from pt. 1 and simply changed the `+=` to `-=`, forgetting that minuend and subtrahend cannot be exchanged like the parts of a sum 🤦‍♂️

This might be the first day where there weren't any weird edge cases or tricks in the actual input that weren't covered by the example. Both parts were solved on the first try!

## Notes

Wasn't able to apply the brute-force approach for part 2 again, as that would likely have taken multiple days, if it didn't crash before due to the numbers getting too large. For the LCM I got some help from Reddit. Someone there [explained why it works](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/18e6vdf/2023_day_8_part_2_an_explanation_for_why_the/), but I still don't really get it.

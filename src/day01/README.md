Task description: [link](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/1)

## Notes

Took a little inspiration from https://github.com/deafpolygon/advent-of-code/blob/main/2023/day01/index.js for part two.

There were some tricky [edge cases](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/1884fpl/2023_day_1for_those_who_stuck_on_part_2/) where simply replacing the number words did not work out.

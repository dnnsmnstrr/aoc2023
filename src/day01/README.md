## Notes

Took a little inspiration from https://github.com/deafpolygon/advent-of-code/blob/main/2023/day01/index.js for part two.

There were some tricky [edge cases](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/1884fpl/2023_day_1for_those_who_stuck_on_part_2/) where simply replacing the number words did not work out.

This was pretty cute too: ![](https://i.redd.it/2023-day-01-this-is-what-i-saw-in-my-head-when-reading-v0-0brn50qokq3c1.jpg?s=d0d503a58f7a3114b8ae5faceed9ea8aecbfffbf)

Task description: [link](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/3)

## Notes

Accidentally almost deleted everything I wrote by committing without being on a branch. Had to use `git reflog` to find my commit and merge it into my main branch.

Test cases from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/s/xHeD2nIP1X)

- Number with no surrounding symbol
- Number with symbol before and after on same line
- Number with symbol vertically above and below
- Number with diagonal symbol in all 4 possible diagonals
- Possible gear with 1, 2, 3 and 4 surrounding numbers
- Gear with different numbers
- Gear with same numbers
- Non gear with 2 unique surrounding numbers
- Number at beginning/end of line
- Number at beginning/end of grid

My part 2 solution takes heavy inspiration from [CodingAP](https://github.com/CodingAP/advent-of-code/blob/main/aoc/puzzles/2023/day03/solution.js). I tried building it up piece by piece, using as many as I could of the concepts I had previously tried.
